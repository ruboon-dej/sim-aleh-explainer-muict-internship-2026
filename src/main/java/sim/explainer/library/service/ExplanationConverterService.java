            because it compares the primitive concept 'Place' with 'Place' so the primitive concept is the same, which increases the similarity degree.
            Additionally, the comparison of the existentials 'some canWalk Trekking' with 'some canWalk Trekking' further increases the similarity degree.
            For 'some canSail Kayaking' and 'some canWalk Trekking', since they are different, the embeddings are examined.
            The embeddings show a similarity between 'canTravelWithSail' for 'Kayaking' and 'canMoveWithLegs' for 'Trekking', which also contributes to the higher similarity degree.
            
            output:
            The comparison between 'ActivePlace' and 'Mangrove' results in a similarity degree of 0.8259. Both are recognized as 'Place' that allow 'can walk with Trekking' and 'can sail with Kayaking'. The embedding comparison highlights a similar functional basis between 'canTravelWithSail' for 'Kayaking' and 'canMoveWithLegs' for 'Trekking', reinforcing their comparability.

            output:
            The comparison between 'Kayaking' and 'Trekking' results in a similarity degree of 0.9701. Both activities share a primitive concept and are similar in the embedding vector space, highlighting a similar functional basis between 'Kayaking' and 'Trekking', which reinforces their comparability.
